ms2icpj	duckyJ81	I feel like so far my 40s are filled with caring for the elderly (parents and dogs) and have recently been contemplating if some of the potentially best years of my own life are going to be completely consumed with caring for financially irresponsible parents and aging dogs.

ms2hl46	gamdalf2000	I tried to avoid memory care with my mom as long as I could but 24 hour home care when done through a service is about $22k per month. You can do it cheaper if you find and hire folks independently via one of the gig economy apps that exist for this purpose. But it’s on you to vet the person, make sure they are engaging with your loved one appropriately (and not just screwing around on their phone the whole time). And if one of those folks drops out suddenly (it happens a lot as caring for someone with dementia can be … trying), you’ve got a gap you need to fill and good luck if you work. Could take a minimum of several days to fix and guess who has to cover those hours in the meantime. Also, don’t forget that your parent has to eat something. The home health aids can help cook simple things but you’ve got to arrange the shopping and other stuff.   Memory care seemed like a bargain at $8k per month.  That said, for that money the care was okay but not great. Some of the staff were jerks. The food was pretty awful.   The memory care folks would send mom to the hospital for *any* falls that she would have (hello litigious America and CYA medical care). She had Parkinson’s so she fell a lot.  Don’t even get me started about hospital stays for someone with dementia. Remember what I said about “trying.” Yeah, magnify that times 1000 when someone who’s disoriented and agitated but redirectable gets to the hospital. Guess where having resources to constantly redirect someone are even more limited? Yep, the hospital.  So then your poor confused loved one is getting dosed with haldol (or newer drugs like it — risperidal, quetiapine). One potential side effect of these drugs is they can affect heart rhythm. That put mom in ICU for 24 hours. In one 48hour period my mom was in 5 (FIVE) different rooms with 5 different casts of care givers. I’d be disoriented myself!  While she was at her assisted living/memory care unit I contracted independently for some of my moms favorite home care helpers to visit her several times per week (another $1.5k per month) to help keep her socialized. I would visit as much as I could as well (also several times per week) so everyday she had at least some time with someone who was paying attention to just her.   But all of this is exhausting if you have a full time job and any other responsibilities (e.g. young kids with baseball games or art shows or whatever).   I love my mom but the stress of the money and the time and the constant worry nearly broke me.  And for what it’s worth, the fancy place that had better food, supposedly more engaged staff and nicer facilities was $20k per month. So unless you are made of money, good luck with that.  Her final chapter was very sad, pretty lonely (despite all my best efforts) and shockingly expensive.  I don’t have an obvious solution just sharing my experience.   Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s dementia, and associated conditions are really, really awful. It’s heartbreaking to see the person you love turn into a shadow of themselves and it’s incredibly hard to stay positive in the face of so much stress and frustration.  For anyone traveling on this path, good luck. It’s hard. You are going to feel really lonely and angry and frustrated at times even if you have a loving partner or excellent friends. You are going to watch savings (either yours or your parents’) dwindle. You are going to want to rage at the system at times and at your parent at times.  It’s ok. Breathe. Know that it will eventually end and your parent will have peace.   But in the meantime, take care of yourself. If you have the wherewithal (Yeay America!), get a therapist to talk through all the complicated feelings you are going to have.   There is nothing easy about any of this.	1747132896.0

ms2gxh4	Constant-Parsley3609	Here's a question for you, suppose that LLMs like chatGPT are conscious somehow.      All that's happening under the hood is a log calculations. In fact, even at a high level it's mostly rather simple calculations like adding and multiplying.      If I set up the software, so that each calculation (every sum, product etc) is performed individually with a large time delay in between, does that consciousness disappear?     If I perform some (or all) of the calculations on different machines, is it still conscious?      What if some of the calculations are performed with pen and paper?     None of these changes would change the eventual output. 	1747132554.0

ms2glce	No-Razzmatazz3091	My heart breaks to read all of the stories, and as time goes on there are going to be more. My sister and I are considering a guide-book for GenXers to have some idea what actual logistical hurdles to expect in the process: all things she and I had to figure out on the fly when our father went into an acute care home for the last 6 mos of his life, and now after our mother -- currently with a terminal autoimmune disorder -- went into a medical crisis where she wants to die at home.   I have been intimately involved with all of our mother's medical care for the past two years. It's hard enough watching the gradual, and now precipitous decline, but what has been most frustrating has been getting information from medical practitioners about how to navigate LIVING through all this. Yes, the irony, living to the point of dying. Though I guess that's what we're all doing on a macro-esoteric level.   I've found the medical professionals are great at giving guidance on how to keep your parent alive, and great at giving guidance on what to do when your parent is at death's doorstep (hours to days in hospice parlance). That HUGE gray space in between? There's a little bit of a shoulder shrug, which I do understand because there are truly infinite ways of going about it, but my sister and I have found while there are an infinite number of ways to execute on living through that gray space, there is a general frame work. And when your parent(s) doesn't want to talk about it, which our mother has not, then it's up to you to create that plan. Which sucks. And it's hard.   To all of you out there who have lived or are living through it, I salute you, my heart goes out to you, and I hope whatever you use to cope gives you strength.	1747132376.0
ms2gkzr	MoonBapple	It's part of a more general sentiment about having someone to be there with you as more of a peer throughout your life. I think people need siblings. I was a very lonely kid and would have liked siblings. My husband is one of nine and one of the things I enjoy most about being married to him is getting to see how he and his siblings interact and getting a taste of that. Having someone to share the load of an aging parent or the death of a parent seems invaluable.  I hope they don't have to take care of me. I've lost track of where I am in all these comments so apologies if I am repeating myself but I've already said here somewhere that one of my health goals is to be a helpful (potential) grandparent in my 60s and 70s - to at least be able to carry a baby, change diapers, rock a baby to sleep, etc... My mom's awful health and mobility issues have meant she couldn't watch her grandkids at all independently. Grandparents are meant to be helpers to parents, so I want to be healthy enough to be a helper at that time instead of a drain.  And fwiw I hope my kids leave my ass in the rain if they feel I'm a shit parent to them. I take care of my mom because she has always been good to me. I give back to her what she gave to me. My dad on the other hand can rot in the gutter for all I care, and frankly I hope he does, because this is a two way street and he only gave pain and suffering when I needed care and love.

They're desperately clinging onto the prosperity they enjoyed since their youth, and have long since cut down the tree their parents planted for them to burn as firewood.  They also cut down the tree they planted for their children for the same purpose, and even today keep demanding more firewood.  There's nothing left.  Experts have been telling us to prepare but the generation that should be taking care of them was never given a fair chance to prepare.  We're going to see a lot of old people cast onto the street by their own children because their children's options will be to cast them out or find themselves going homeless alongside them.

ms2gbk3	NinaHag	In my experience (UK & Spain) that is not the case. Universal healthcare is great, sure, but it only goes so far. For example, grandpa falls down, he is swiftly taken to hospital and taken care of, when he's recovered, they send him home. All for free. Great. But when grandpa has dementia and should not be going home, there are little to no care options for him. You have to fight tooth and nail to get anything, usually two hours per week of a care worker dropping by. Does grandpa need 24/7 care? Tough luck, unless you have thousands to pay for a private care home (cheap ones are around 3k per month), you won't get a spot in a public one because folks who are REALLY unwell and destitute get priority.  So families have to do most of the caring. If grandma is dead, the family may sell grandpa's home to pay for his care, but that takes months and the money will eventually run out. What infuriates me the most about this is that care homes cost a fortune yet the carers are not well paid. They work so hard, physically and mentally, but all the money is being hoarded by the business owners. Absolute BS.	1747132230.0

ms2etwj	CodAlternative3437	i dont think everyones figured this out. my MIL is in korea at home with dementia. ive asked about what they want/can do and they would have to pay out of pocket for an in-home caregiver and it wasnt clear but i think like the US, you can get into a place but they are not well regarded. which can be dicey af, not closely regulated and news stories of abusive staff.  but youll have to be impoverished to qualify, basically the same as applying for Medicaid in the US. they may also require the children to cosign the debt for what the insurance doesnt pay.   one thing that was interesting is that they allow kids to train and become eligible for a caregiver supplement. you take a 6 month certificate course in nursing and dementia care and the government pays you a stipend to be the at home caregiver. i think it was like 600 USD a month.   in the US, my wife had an application for at home care company and among the pledges you sign for, they require you to report/promise the patient isnt a relative. which is weird, but there apparently are agencies out there that will hire you and whether unethical/fraudulent or not, they apply for the medicaid and you get paid as an employee for being the home caregiver of your parent. makes total sense to me but in the US that would probably be unamerican for the "little guy" to benefit from the system  edit: i went down the rabbit hole and well, yes. it seems, in some states you can legally get paid by your parents to be their caregiver. even before medicaid kicks in, so you basically have your parents pay you (liquidate their assets) then when the hit medicaid eligibility theres other options or you just put them in a home at that point, change your telephone number and take a vacation to aruba	1747131421.0

ms2cbk2	Catalysst	I don't personally identify as having rocks for brains  but maybe some people.  If you ask an AI whether it is conscious it will at least give a reply.  The same can't be said for the other things I listed.  Of course one could imagine that a rock is conscious but it's difficult to prove when it doesn't have any means to communicate or even move any part of itself.  A planet could be conscious in a mother earth kind of way but it's still more of a reach than saying AI is conscious.  If we go for the mother earth idea then I guess everything on earth is a part of that. Humans and even AI itself would be part of the earth consciousness - assuming that to be true doesn't really get us closer to discovering anything though.  In any case it would be silly to jump straight there instead of first at least going for the low hanging fruit - things that can communicate.  I'm not sure where you are trying to go with your definition of conscious because you haven't really explained any of your thought process.	1747129992.0

ms292m2	argrejarg	CGRP antagonists have complicated functions. They are at least promising for neuroinflammation, and also have some small amount of evidence that they are (indirectly) effective against infection as an immunomodulator \[ [PMID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMID_(identifier)) [29754819](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29754819) \]. There are a lot of quite idiosyncratic progressive neurological problems, manifesting as headaches and/or fits, where migraine or anti-epilepsy medication isn't necessarily a bad idea although also very far from guaranteed.  Drawing a line between an infectious disease and an autoimmune or even a neurodevelopmental condition can be very difficult if one was triggered by the other, and anyway might not give much information for treatment: for an example, the antibiotic ceftriaxone happens to increase/repair glutamate reuptake, so it can modulate excitotoxicity and the related inflammation, whether you have life bacteria in your head or not. Ceftriaxone isn't to be taken lightly, especially not via cannula, but I wouldn't say no if it were prescribed to me in these circumstances.	1747128033.0

Three hours later, you can start taking your medicines. Repeat as needed. Eventually you should only have to do this once a week for General health and maintenance.   Oil of oregano kills everything, the clay grabs everything killed and takes it out of your system. Well also healing your gut.   You can also swish the water with oil of oregano in it in your mouth for several minutes in the mornings, it will help with any unknown dental infection you might have in your mouth.   Make sure the oil up oregano is diluted, you can find the small bottles in any health food store, sprouts, etc.  Yeah, you can get it online, but I would get it in the store so you know exactly what you’re getting.  I just said a prayer for you. Good luck.	1747126082.0

ms24za8	davedcne	In the US there are only very narrow cases where the next gen can be on the hook for their parents debts. Usually only in the case of fradulent transfers of assets. IE you give your child your house before going into long term care and die within 5 years of that. If you used your homeless status to gain medicare, the state could come at you for the debt and the creditor could sue that the transfer was used as an attempt to evade debt. Creditors can also use a 5 year lookback period.  Beyond that though you owe nothing, if the debts can't be recovered from your parents estate they are simply lost. You don't inheret anything since the order of operations in the us is: administration fees for the estate > Burial/funeral costs > taxes > creditors > inheritors. In that order. But if the estate reaches 0 before it gets to you that's it process ends.  So if you really want to ensure your heirs get anything. Predict when you're going to die. And make sure you give them everything you want to give them 6 years prior. Or more rationally. Set up an irrevocable trust for some assets while you are still in good health to make certain its sheltered from the bullshit that surrounds the long term care industry.	1747125458.0

ms24ig9	SohndesRheins	The guy that started the nursing home corporation I work for has a yacht in the Florida Keys and a second yacht on the Great Lakes. He used to own his own private jet. Yes, he did also own a chain of regional banks, but he didn't decide to sell the nursing homes for many many years, so they obviously were more profitable than stock market returns or else he wouldn't have held on to them. I never got to see the actual expenses and profit margins, just the raw revenue. What I can say is that if the profit margin is better than just investing the money, then a nursing home makes a shitoad of money every year.	1747125157.0

ms24azp	abriefmomentofsanity	My parents did an OK job as parents. Not amazing. Not terrible. I can confidently say, especially now looking back as a fully-formed adult myself, that there were times when they chose themselves rather than their children and also times where they sacrificed to provide. Nothing revelatory there. Very human. I know people with worse childhoods and people with better. I've made my peace with that and moved forward as best I can with the advantages and disadvantages such a middle-of-the-road parentage affords. They've made it clear they intend to burn through what they have in their lifetime and leave myself and my siblings with very little beyond what we already received (for the most part a roof over our heads until we had a place of our own, and a used car for my brother when he got his license- sourced from my father's sister IIRC). In fact my great aunt indicated she would live to leave her not insignificant estate in part to us upon her passing and what that realistically means is that my parents will receive a windfall likely around the time they've completely drained their own retirement funds, and will proceed to pick that clean as well. They sold their house and bought an RV to travel the country. It wasn't lost on myself, my siblings, or even them that in doing so they turned their back on what is likely to be the single most important asset boomers of moderate means can hand down to millennials in passing. To be clear, they have that right. They earned that money. They've earned their retirement. I won't begrudge them that. However, when the time comes to take care of them as they did me, I fully intend to follow the example they have set. I will provide what is reasonable, while making sure to balance that with my own interests.	1747125025.0

ms23w01	Ali_Cat222	What's really unfortunate is in the city I'm in right now, so many people are going through situations where they can't afford care for their elderly parents. So what they do is they'll take them to the mental health hospital and make up a claim about them wanting to harm themselves, or mention the fact that they have Alzheimer's etc. and are at risk of harming themselves, and just leave them there as long as possible.   I had to do the mental health stays a few times back when I had addiction issues, the amount of elderly people there for this exact reason was actually insane to see in person.

ms239v1	davedcne	On the one hand this is bad for those who have loved ones who are going to end up in longterm care. On the other hand. As Gen X, I know many of us cut all ties at some point in our adult lives. So not our fucking problem.  As for our own long term care... I recommend making sure you have a health care proxy, a will, some one you can trust to handle things for you if you become incapacitated. Also have an exit plan.

No, it couldn't...even if there was enough matter for it to spread that far, it can't spread that fast.  It would be able to work only slightly faster than single-cell organisms do to reproduce.  Much faster, and they would cause enough friction to incinerate themselves.  Some matter will also be harder for it to work with than others.  From my understanding, breaking apart neutron star matter would take more energy to pull apart than they could muster.

ms235r0	hoshikuun083	Hello. Physician here. I'm not native speaker so I excuse myself in case of language errors when using technical terms.  I think that the main problem is that your medical team couldn't figure the pathogen, over the fact that medicines didn't work. So, more than looking after a better treatment, I think that the priority is to perform a more sensitive test that can detect the pathogen.  A redditor asked AI and got some interesting suggestions to perform a more sensitive diagnostic test.  I read a comment of yours that added the fact that your physician said that the bacteria didn't grow on the plate. I think that maybe, they haven't done enough molecular testing of your CSF and they relied mostly on cultures.   You stated that your disease started after a gastrointestinal infection when you were pregnant. A bacteria that could cause enteritis, is associated with immunosuppressed states such pregnancy, is associated with meningitis (also Guillain Barre and Encephalitis), and is very difficult to grow in plates is Campylobacter, but its just a guess based on what you have stated. It doesn't seem to me that your disease could be caused by TB, nor viruses or fungus. So i think that a deeper bacterial testing is needed.  So, again, I would look after the most advanced infection research centers in Europe to get a deeper testing and then, look after a specific treatment; maybe at that moment, some of the treatments suggested here could help.  I deeply hope that you get a definitive diagnosis and a successful treatment.	1747124294.0

When it comes time for LTC they won't have any assets tj take so the nursing home will take their Social Security checks and the government will have to foot the bill for the rest of it.

ms20v8o	Sirisian	> Why would you even do this?  From a futurology perspective, there's an idea that humans will reach a point where megaprojects become easier due to automation and large amounts of energy. The world and businesses over a long period will become more and more connected. International travel for example is a trend we look at which shows a near continuous increase in people going further distances around the world for various reasons. (Despite having the ability to work remote and make video calls). Such trends could create a situation where countries look at an optimal way to move people and goods. (A way to remove cargo ships for example completely and use a purely electric low friction propulsion system). Given those parameters countries would then decide to standardize a vactrain system and in parallel construct [small corridors](https://i.imgur.com/mwwzukn.jpeg) (just a napkin example) along with one primary corridor.  It would be described in marketing as a way to implement essentially teleportation for people and goods. You could meet someone on the other side of the Earth for breakfast and not even pack a bag. For a business they can ship almost any item overnight. Simply getting it to a hub and into a cargo pod would have it across the world (exceeding even human comfortable accelerations) in a few hours. In this future a weekend vacation is basically anywhere you can imagine, like deciding to go to Italy in the early morning and heading home at night. As long as you can get to a hub then you can basically jump anywhere. I don't expect it would completely replace air travel, but we might see eVTOL short flights to hubs in this setup.  > how are you going to deal with the mid-Atlantic Ridge?  In my image I specifically skip that problem by never crossing it. An equally hard problem is bridging the bearing straight with an underwater section. It would use a massive version of [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm2ekl2agyM) potentially. Still have to go 53+ miles, and it might float above the sea floor. (Would be probably a trillion at this scale. Hard to picture, but it would be like massive 53 mile horizontal skyscraper).  Essentially the main corridor in that image would be tons (maybe 100? depending on required capacity) parallel tubes with merging airlocks. Replacing air travel and a lot of cargo if I remember correctly requires a lot of throughput, but it would be quite efficient when running full speed.  There's also thermal expansion. You're hitting on topics that would need to be solved. You can pre-stress certain materials or thermally control them allowing them to shrink/grow over kilometers. Unclear what would be the best strategy. (Personally I'm leaning toward a massive above, with partially below, ground concrete structure with temperature control).  Not perfectly related, but LIGO has four ulta-high vacuum 4 km arms that required quite a lot of R&D with high tolerances. The next iteration, Cosmic Explorer will feature 40 km arms. Still not anywhere close to this scope, but engineers are getting good at building precision vacuum tubes. The timeline for a world-wide transport is such a far future concept that a lot of engineering challenges might seem trivial by then. There's a point where you can build segments that work individually and connecting them and it continues to work. Or that would be the ideal as this thing would need to be built by thousands of individual teams following the same general blueprints.	1747122867.0

Ever see a healthcare company sponsor a sports team or stadium?  Commercials and advertisements everywhere?  Salaries of executives?  There's a reason they try to deny everything first, and there's a reason a guy like Luigi exists.  It's not because society is unsustainable, it's because *capitalism* is unsustainable and anything that is necessary for living should absolutely *not* be for-profit.  Americans are charged more for services rendered than anywhere else in the world - also, studies have consistently shown that the growth in prices has not meant that the service quality offered has improved either, in fact quality of outcomes has not improved markedly at all since we started measuring this.  Americans pay significantly more, for equal or less equivalent outcomes than other economies with single-payer healthcare systems, and seem to like it (or, more specifically, government has been incentivized to like it due to lobbying and outright corruption).	1747122157.0

Then she developed scleroderma (she never had it before, so her rheumatologist thinks it was a response to getting infected with SARS-CoV-2), and now she spends most of her days napping and sitting in her recliner.

Life is about give and take. Sometimes people help us, and sometimes we help them. Keeping score isn't productive.  Now, if someone's parents were abusive/neglectful/disowned them for being gay/etc., then they are well within their rights not to undertake the arduous task of caring for a sick, elderly person.	1747120512.0

This gives me the credentials to teach the subject of botany... When you lower the carbon dioxide levels two 100s of a percent.. plants begin to suffer and die off without the ability to make us any food to eat.. so do you really think it's to our best interests to lower carbon dioxide levels when plants are dying in front of you right this minute by the millions of species have already become extinct because of too low on carbon dioxide levels....

You make contracts with people you don’t trust, so you can take them to court in case they betray you. It’s antithetical to the idea of finding someone with whom you break down walls and barriers more than anyone else in your life.   The POINT is the danger actual commitment brings.

ms1uqdr	Netlawyer	When my stepfather (of 37 years) tripped in a parking lot and hit his head in 2014 - the warfarin he was on due to other health issues resulted in a brain bleed that put him into a 2 week coma.   He was in his 80’s and my mom was in her 70’s - and her reaction and shock suggested that they had never even contemplated anything *other* that he would just fall down dead one day.   Not that he would need rehabilitative care for years, that they would have to move quickly to a house with no steps for him to come home.  Or even that she would regularly need to call 911 to pick him up when he fell because she couldn’t lift him.   It seemed like a complete surprise, and I can’t figure out why.   I know there will come a point when I fall or break a hip or for whatever reason can’t care for myself and I’m planning for that.  I don’t know the day or what age I will be - but for them to have never even thought about it.       Is it a boomer thing?   That everything’s cool until it isn’t?  You are going to live forever and as long as you feel fine, nothing to worry about, just deal with it after?  My mom (now 82) is still being the same way - she’s planning to live in her house for the rest of her life - but refuses to talk about needing care or what if she needs to move to a specialized facility (her sister had advanced dementia and was living in a care facility until she fell and died from a brain bleed).	1747119144.0

ms1uchr	Frost-Folk	I think that taking your relationship day by day and having the mutual understanding that either party can communicate their feelings on the relationship *at any time* is better than setting a date in the future to reassess on.  I don't really believe in the institution of marriage but that doesn't mean I want it replaced by some other contract. Checking in with your partner is very important, and if you want to decide on a specific date to do that, then by all means, but I don't expect that to become the norm.  Reassurance and checking in can happen at any time. I don't want to have to feel like I need to wait until the upcoming date to voice my concerns, nor do I want to feel the impending dread of that date coming and my partner having some feelings they had been bottling up for that date.  I'd prefer my partner just tell me how they're feeling when they're feeling it. Reassurance and checking is still important, it just doesn't need to be scheduled years in advance.	1747118918.0

Now, seeing how many people complain about the lack of stable relationships despite also having the attitude that "things should change from the "old model""... it seems like many are not liking it either.  “Vow by Will” tries to solve the pain of divorce by pre-normalizing separation, and in doing so, sabotages the very thing that makes deep relationships worth it.	1747118793.0

ms1susw	Technical_Shake_9573	Well good Luck on that. Throughout history, having heirs only served as assets. It's only recently that we did care about children differently than just free labor.  Having children never meant having a status symbol, but a mean to an end to enrich yourself.  Reminder that he was legal in lots of countries to hit your child to " educate" them. So we may just go back to a Time where children are viewed as money earners, rather than viewed as a wonderfull life choice.	1747118055.0

ms1sojn	RainaElf	when my grandmother died 25 years ago, that's when I went straight home, changed the locks on my apartment, and started getting paperwork together and have kept it updated since. I was 31 then.  my mom and her husband behaved "poorly" to say the very least, and I'm not allowing anything of the kind ever happen to me; I pray often they go long before I do.  also hard agree about the doctors.	1747117954.0
ms1socb	silverwitch76	I'm GenX. My parents (silent gen) died within 3 months of each other. My dad had to be put in a memory care facility about 6 months prior to my mom's cancer diagnosis. So, 9 months of his care plus the 3 months of my mother's hospice at a nursing home care. When it was all said and done, it cost roughly 100k. My parents saved like crazy their entire adult lives. We lived very frugally. My siblings and I ended up with a small inheritance each after the sale of their home. I am eternally grateful for that inheritance and I know I am an outlier in even getting any inheritance.    I now provide care for my FIL on an as needed basis and have sat down with MIL and FIL to map out what the next few years look like. We all expect that within the next 5 years, I will be taking on a daily role with MIL taking night shift as she has to continue to work to maintain insurance and income for life in general. Again, I (and they) are outliers because my kids ages, our financial situations and our close proximity lined up to where we can make this work. The big caveat though is that myself, MIL and my SO all need to stay healthy enough that I can provide the care needed and MIL and SO can continue to work. If one of us falls seriously ill or either MIL or SO lose their jobs...we are all screwed.   I worked in nursing homes for a bit and it killed me to have to put my dad in one. Mom refused to let me care for him and she couldn't provide the care he needed, so she shipped him to memory care. The facility he was at was a very nice one and I feel he received above average care while there, but mom paid through the nose for it. The short time mom was in the nursing home, she finally understood why I fought her so hard on not sending dad to a care facility. She didn't want to believe me when I told her the horrors I had witnessed while working as a CNA. She assumed that she would get CNAs like me or the pitiful few of my coworkers who gave it our all. She quickly realized I was not exaggerating about how short staffed every nursing home was and how quickly the staff turned over/how few permanent staff members there were with the rest being agency.   Boomers will be heading into LTC facilities in droves in the next few years. There simply aren't enough facilities/beds and staffing is only going to get worse and worse. Costs will continue to skyrocket and most of my generation can't help their parents financially or physically as we're barely scraping by as it is. Add in how abysmal most of GenX and their parent's relationships are, and there's not a whole lot of impetus to provide care and/or money to our parents. I hear a lot of my friends say some variation of "they didn't take care of me when I was a kid, why should I take care of them when they're old?". So, yeah...boomers will be reaping what they sowed decades ago. Maybe the younger boomers will see it hitting their older counterparts and try to make some changes. I, personally, doubt it. Even if they surprise me though, I'm pretty sure it will be too little too late.	1747117951.0
ms1sks0	laziestmarxist	I'm the same age as you, my mom is a bit younger than yours. I've always lived with her because I've never been able to find a job that would pay rent on my own. The per month price you were quoted for your mom's care would be more than I make in a year.  Sometimes I just hope she goes quickly; we already did homecare for my dad for ten years and it was grueling and I had to work as many hours as possible to make sure at least *some* income came into the home. I don't know who I'd have watch her if she became immobile because I'd still have to work if that happened.	1747117892.0

ms1sfsz	EmilyAnne1170	I also expect no inheritance. And I firmly believe that people SHOULD have to use up all of their own assets before Medicaid covers everything. It’s not everyone else’s responsibility to cover the cost. Not the family, not society.  My aunt and uncle were fuming that they had to sell my grandma’s house and use the money to hire home care nurses because her \[taxpayer-funded\] insurance didn’t cover it all.  After years of ranting about the people on WIC and welfare getting a piece of their tax dollars. Zero self-awareness.	1747117813.0
ms1scxn	UserWithno-Name	It’s not just USA. It’s a widespread issue. Japan is also facing a terrible cliff. It’s the result of a world that rewards greed above all and old generations who don’t think young deserve a decent life now for somehow the promise to maybe get it when you’re 70 and also about to die yourself? It’s worse in areas and America is one, but it’s a pretty global problem of any developed nation rn. still can be anywhere because without money and trained people or the privilege yourself to take care of aging relatives, it’s just as bad as places where that care is super expensive or that the family does not have the time or luxury (or desire) to provide some of the care to offset costs somewhat. This is the world we’ve built. Not just Americans	1747117768.0

ms1s75g	MoonBapple	I gotta admit that my experience with my mom is one of the reasons I'm having two kids. I'm an only child, so it's me or the streets at this point. I want my kids to be able to (potentially) split the responsibility if it comes to that... Not the only reason for the 2nd kid of course but it does factor in.  I definitely recommend saving every penny you can, though. I understand it isn't possible for everyone, but if at all possible, it can't hurt. Worst case scenario you have a small emergency fund when you retire... I explained in another comment but my mom legitimately thought she'd be dead by now, so she didn't save shit and actively regrets it.  She's kind of only *just* getting over the fact she's sticking around, actually? In 2020 she almost died from just medically neglecting herself, she let her diabetes go, had kidney stones removed, got sepsis and did pretty severe damage to her kidneys in the process... (Very stressful with 2020 being *great* time to go to the ER with kidney failure and sepsis lol.) If I hadn't been around to call 911, she would've died face down on the bathroom floor. It would've been just how we always joked it would be: we'll find her when she starts to stink.  I also don't want to overlook the importance of the family you choose over the family you get by blood. My mom isn't social and it's a major vulnerability for her. She's weirdly(?) ashamed of her aging body and can't imagine herself having fun at the community center with other old people, even though she'd probably benefit a great deal from making some friends her own age.   It might be too late to have your own kids, but it's never too late to make friends and grow your social circle. People rely on people, and people build found families all the time. Stay social, it has a huge protective benefit.  Wishing the best for you as well ❤️	1747117677.0

ms1rxu7	rotetiger	I'm also curious to hear the answer.  In my experience care is a labor intensive work. You need several professions with several skills/education to take care for one person.

ms1rw0o	UserWithno-Name	Yes we are. We are just going to let them deal with it and expire.

Nope. I also have a disabled adult kiddo who needs my help periodically and it's draining as hell, and the extra room in my home is for her if she ever needs it, not for my mom.

ms1qxs2	MoonBapple	The ER will turn her away (she already knows about her injury and is receiving treatment from an orthopedic specialist) or refer her to... Rehab. Which she was already referred to by her orthopedic specialist, and that referral was already rejected, so... Might as well not chase her tail and leave the ER resources for the actively dying.  Long term care isn't considered a medical service... Even though the services would be provided by the exact same facility, and would largely the same as if she was approved for rehab, like meals and basic nursing care etc. So the workaround is that they take your social security on a sliding scale (90%)...   And to clarify what that means... My mom gets $1000 in social security, they want $900. If she got the maximum social security benefit of $5108, the long term care facility would ask for $4597.20 of it, because they ask specifically for 90%. (Or this is my basic understanding of the system.) So even people who get a good amount from social security, they're trapped in long term care unless someone can bridge their housing for a couple of months until their SS funds come back under their personal control.  I'm upset for my mom, but I'm appalled by both what I've learned about the long term care system AND the Republican desire to end social security. Shit takes all around really.  One workaround is to have a home health aide, which can also be a family member who is hired by a home health company, trained and then assigned to their own family member. It's very common to live together already in this scenario. The aide can get paid a little to help out for a few hours a week, which seems nice until you realize the home health company bills Medicare/Medicaid for the services, pockets their profit margin and pays the aide minimum wage.  System's fucked, boss.	1747116956.0
ms1qxh9	Technical_Shake_9573	Well dementia Isn't really what you picture as a death sentence, because first you have to see lose yourself to the disease and become and entirely different person.  It's like Alzheimer, that's worst than death imo because your reason to live just gets erased .

ms1qsyj	throw_away99877	There is a solution to all of this. It's for elderly people to repeatedly commit petty crimes so they get locked up in prisons, turning prisons into state-run nursing homes like what's happening in Japan.	1747116878.0
ms1qqih	Netlawyer	Having conversations with my 82 yo mom who has $500k in the bank from her husband’s life insurance and gets ~$2k social security a month.  She is living fine on SS, paid for house, is on Medicare - no significant health issues.    She’s like, “well I have the money, why shouldn’t I spend it while I can enjoy it?” And I am supportive if she needs the money but she doesn’t need a whole house renovation at 82.  (We’ll get money from her paid off house when the time comes.)  Contra me at 59, still working - “oh shit I’ve only got $1.5m in retirement assets after selling my house.   I’m going to run out of money and end up in sitting in my own filth when I get old.”  tbh, there is a certain amount of denial with my mom.  As soon as I raise the fact that she will need transitional or long term care (and will need to pay for it), it kind shatters the image she has of herself and she gets really defensive - so the conversation shuts down.   Where I am frantically saving because I know I will need that care someday and have no illusions about it.	1747116841.0

ms1qhbv	LongjumpingStudy3356	Sounds simple but defining the exact point at which the mind is "gone" enough to warrant getting rid of life extension techniques is not so easy. Dementia happens in stages and isn't a binary "all here" or "all gone" type of thing. If you look at standardized tests of cognition, you will see that they will rate impairments as mild, moderate, and severe. There is no point on these spectra that sticks out to me as clearly defining "GONE". Sure, someone who is super, super severe is clearly gone, but people that are in the moderate and mod-sev range are much harder to draw lines for. And with things like sundowning, it gets even more tricky because Belinda at 10 AM is not Belinda at 8 PM.  Defining what is and isn't life extension is also not straightforward. Antibiotics might be a comfort care thing if the patient is suffering from a UTI. Getting vaccinated against the flu is also a quality-of-life thing. The flu may or may not kill an 85 year old, but it sure won't be comfortable for them, so it's best avoided. I've even had patients tell me they didn't want vitamins and supplements because they didn't want to artificially extend their lives........ But I doubt that popping a Vitamin C pill is actually going to add any extra years to your life... Drawing these lines isn't simple	1747116699.0

As great an idea it is to at least begin somewhere, [the average median cost of assisted living in Wa state is $72k per year](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/assisted-living-costs-by-state) and it’s even more costly in D.C., Alaska or Rhode Island.

If not a cure, as with an antibiotic treatment, they could at least reduce inflammation caused by  your meningitis. These are supplements manufactured by a wide variety of companies, so you would want to make your own choices on brand. Dosing would also be up to you to test and try. There is a lot of good scientific research by trusted institutions supporting benefits of proteolytics for reducing chronic inflammation and alleviating symptoms in different chronic illnesses.

ms1oqtg	zombieslaya589	I know that this isn’t medical related, but I think this is worth stating.   I think it’s worth reading the bible and even trying to build a relationship with God, I mean even C.S. Lewis said “Jesus is either the son of God, a lunatic, or the devil himself.”  I’m saying this because I once had a scary situation, I was smoking like crazy partying every other weekend and eventually my brain started playing tricks on me, I started to hear voices and truly believed that I was going schizophrenic *I am not thank the lord. But with that situation I started praying realizing that my situation was out of my hands, that the life I was living was a mess and I couldn’t do it without some help.  Summary of that is I prayed to God, not knowing of what was going to happen and he answered in his own way, but a way I could understand.   The world will tell you everything about how he doesn’t exist and that Christians are crazy and hypocrites, but at the end of the day there’s so much proof that God exists, and that Jesus existed, that he is God, it’s all out there it just takes someone willing to believe and accept.   I hope even though that this message isn’t about medicine, that you read it and it find you in good spirits because what is the worst in believing Jesus Christ.  He loves you, and cares for you more than you would ever know. Please try reading the bible.	1747115736.0

ms1nzj0	sSnowblind	Like everything American, LTC insurance is a for-profit industry.  They make their money primarily on it being INCREDIBLY hard to access when you need it.  Most people who qualify to tap into it find it very difficult and the criteria for qualifying is frequently pretty narrow.    My parents paid for the Cadillac plan of LTC as married members of the same union for YEARS.  My dad had a really rough 11 months before he passed and wasn't able to tap into it once because it really expected all other avenues of payments to come first and a more or less 'consistent' treatment plan for a 90d period.  The palliative care people with the hospital gave us the heads up on how terrible it would be to access and they were not lying.  A 1-800 number that closed at 4PM Eastern... just somebody who sounded like they were a robot at a call center in Florida.  No other means of contacting them other than the phone and physical mail.  If you missed a call or a voicemail EVERYTHING stopped until you got back in touch with the rep.  Absolutely nightmarish that they're counting on senior citizens (or their family who doesn't know fuck all about their insurance) to deal with this during periods of trauma or disability or just plain old age.	1747115327.0

ms1n83f	Sunnyhappygal	That's kind of what I figured, and almost makes me favor the "made up" scenario-  because if they haven't found any bacteria it seems very odd to have specifically identified it as bacterial infection, eh?    Like there are so many other possible causes, autoimmune vs inflammatory vs viral vs other weird infections.  So if it's unidentifed, how are we able to carve out all those other possibilities?   I suppose it's possible that they just don't understand what their doctors are telling them, and they heard them mention looking for bacteria, and that's how they interpreted it.    But even if that's the case, the "I will die of this in 1-2 years" seems dramatic, people get staged for cancers with a timeline like that but I'm not aware of people being given a specific timeline like that for an undiagnosed disease.	1747114927.0

ms1m7o5	ChewieBearStare	I went through it last year, and it's honestly awful. After his 90 days of Medicare coverage ran out (you get 100 per benefit period, but he'd already used 10 during a previous skilled nursing stay), we were paying $27,000/month for my FIL to be in a vent-weaning facility that has a 1-star rating on Medicare.gov. Why didn't we put him somewhere better? Because there were only three facilities in the entire state (PA, not a tiny state like RI or DE) that were both in-network with his Medicare Advantage Plan and capable of accommodating ventilator-dependent patients. One was about 5 hours from his home (where many of his family members live), one was in a major city that would be difficult for his relatives to get to since they're older and don't like/aren't good at city driving, and then this one was 2.5 hours from his home.  Every time we called, we often had to call back four or five times before someone would answer the phone. He did have one good nurse that we relied on to give us detailed reports, but they were so understaffed that they would often have agency nurses who had never worked with vent patients before. At one point, I visited when they had an agency LPN as the only nurse on duty for the entire unit. She went into a patient's room, came out, and told the respiratory therapist (in front of me) that she'd crushed up the patient's meds to put into his feeding tube and then realized when she went in there that he didn't have a feeding tube. It sure gave me a lot of confidence in their attention to detail.  My FIL's time there ended when the staff ignored/didn't notice his doctor's order to discontinue his Coumadin. He developed a GI bleed, and his hemoglobin dropped to 6.0 (critically low). However, they never contacted us about it, and they didn't take him to the hospital or seek any additional medical attention. The last time I visited him in the facility, I immediately noticed that he was pale and had a heart rate around double his baseline (120-130). He also appeared to have a distended abdomen. At the time, I didn't know he had a GI bleed since they never told us.   I was enough of a thorn in their side that they transferred him to the ER around 12 hours after I arrived. We later found out that when they drew blood the day before my visit, they ordered an INR check but never got the result and didn't follow up with the lab. They continued giving him the Coumadin despite his doctor's order to discontinue it. By the time he got to the ER, his INR was 5.9 (critically high).  The doctors at the hospital told us they didn't feel it would be ethical to subject a vent-dependent patient who was paralyzed, unable to speak, and unable to eat to an invasive procedure, so we did a compassionate extubation and transferred him to inpatient hospice. He died the next day. His heart kept working harder and harder until it finally hit a rate of over 300 BPM, and then it just stopped.  This is what $27,000 per month buys you in America. Sorry for the length of this comment. I am just incredibly passionate about trying to draw attention to these terrible facilities. I only hope that when it's my time to go, I drop dead rather than having a prolonged illness.	1747114389.0

I have usually seen this when someone has something catastrophic happen and they need emergency surgery. Surgery with general anesthesia frequently requires intubation and it definitely requires intubation for longer cases or if someone is circling the drain. That opens the door for situations like, “Well they JUST need to be intubated during surgery and they will survive with the surgery.”   But what does survival really look like? It’s usually vastly different for a 35 year old vs a 95 year old, as one would imagine. It’s a very slippery slope.	1747114249.0

I mean, the demand to cut 880bn from the Medicaid budget - which is literally the entire budget of Medicaid - over the next 10 years? That's very obviously meant to coincide with the next democratic presidency (assuming we have another election...) and they know people will blame the Dems for their dog shit because of the timing.   They could just move fast and break Medicaid right away, but that wouldn't do as much political damage; it would immediately backfire.  I'm so fucking fed up man. The only silver lining would be shutting social security and disability down fast and having it shock the system, it would also rapidly backfire, but it would also leave hundreds of thousands of people like you vulnerable to homelessness and death, and that shouldn't be the price we have to pay to get out of this hell.

But how do you get more exercise when you're hobbling around on a broken leg? Or when moving the wrong way could break something else?  I'm just totally hopeless over it. I'm on board with my mom as long as she wants to keep at it, because ultimately it's her choice, but I don't think physician assisted suicide is completely off the table in even the next 10 years. If at some point she is all done with this shit, I'm here to support whatever she wants to do.  Sorry to hear about your own case, osteoporosis is way worse than I ever imagined. I always just kinda thought of it as "be careful and don't fall down" and didn't realize it could be this debilitating this easily. 💔 Many extremely gentle hugs to you.	1747112822.0
ms1j5fh	bagheera369	Fuck...my grandmother's 90+, and fortunately, still safe and stable in her home, with my mom handling the basic support systems....for now. She has enough to make it to her end, no matter what happens.   My mom is 70+, lives in a senior assisted AND federally assisted apartment, on only SS....she's fucked.....and she voted for every fucking blow she's about to get from this new government.   I have told my mom, that they're both going to have to make it to the end off grandmother's assets, because my wife and I don't have it to give.....and she cannot under any circumstances, come live with me....a) because she's too toxic to allow in my house, and b) because I can't sacrifice my marriage, and any small bit of future stability we have, to save her.   I had to explain to her, that our retirement plan was already completely based on self-exiting, when that time comes, and while I don't wish that on anyone else,....this is America...and its only freedom you really have here.   My father, and my wife's parents are ALL out of the picture, and going to do whatever they do....we won't be there for any of it.....the kids they had that covet inheritance, can all go handle that shit....we want nothing from any of them.   We are child-free, and will never have to worry about being a burden on anyone, and as we saw a lot of this instability and the boomer care issues coming a mile away, and we both got late start on careers....it's the most responsible thing we can do.   It's not worth letting this country turn us into the people that have to scam, steal, scheme, or stomp on someone else, simply to get by or ahead....the moral compass is too precious.   It sucks. Truly. I'd love to have been born somewhere else, where this grimdark future was not the new normal....but we're here, and we've got to do the best we can, with what we've got.	1747112812.0

ms1iap5	Ursi-Dae	I work in nursing homes in a specialized position, I see 15 different homes weekly. The staffing is abysmal, the medical care is abysmal, the funding is abysmal. Corps buy up these buildings and then cheap out on everything. They do no training, any persons who are good can’t take the abysmal environment and leave. The ones who stay do it for the wrong reasons. This cycle continues as the building gets fines and pays the state as regulators come through, but it’s just the cost of business.   Hospice is likely my least favorite aspect of it. The care doesn’t improve as they are using the same core infrastructure. I know one person who spent 56k for 5 weeks of hospice for their mother. The commodification of death with the false promises of comfort as they sit and let people fester is gut wrenching and why I won’t be able to continue in the facilities long either. I do what I can in my limited time with each facility and staff but in the end I’m in no position to make real change and the environment is so toxic and heart breaking.   Oh and another thing people might not know is a thing. There are funds out there who offer to buy up people’s life insurances so that they don’t have to keep paying a premium. The funds then pay the premium and until the persons death and then they get the insurance payout. I have heard the people who are part of the funds, and the talk about hoping people die sooner cause they make more money that way, it’s utterly vile.   The nursing homes are not that much different, you’re right about the true transfer of wealth, people who thought they would keep homes or land in the family are going to be sorely mistaken as insurances and orgs like the VA pay less and less all while corporate owned medical facilities treat people, their health, and their death like a line on the ledger. I’m disgusted with it all.	1747112397.0
ms1i7mm	MoonBapple	Fwiw she can see a podiatrist and get a heel lift. My husband also broke his leg in his mid-20's and has a short leg... And they put his foot back on crooked 😂 so also a bit of a waddle... But having well made supports in his shoes, including a heel lift, helps a great deal. It can fuck up your entire spine if you're walking on a short leg for long so I highly recommend it.  At this point I've seen ortho fuck up significantly more often than not and I have now placed musculoskeletal health higher on my priority list... Just gotta be something about ortho, it's either *waaay* harder to get right than other specialties or it's where shitty docs/surgeons go to rot. No ortho for me if I can help it.  But anyways I hear you 100% - during 2019 my mom had kidney stones removed and subsequently developed a severe UTI, kidney infection and eventually sepsis in early 2020 (the best time to get severely ill!!!) which left her laying face down on the bathroom floor. If I hadn't been around to call 911, she absolutely would have died there.  She had been falling for a while too, but it wasn't until she had a spinal fracture that anyone caught on. In the coming months she would frequently fall and not want to tell her doctors and I had to rat on her during doctor's visits 🤦  Around this time I took a college course called "Parenting Across The Lifespan" which included a unit on aging parents. I remember my professor saying something like *"Everyone always wants it to go backwards, but it doesn't. That's just not how it works."* It was hard but I tried to lean into that myself, and it took the broken spine to really put the fear of God in my mom and get her to see she had to be honest with doctors and manage some of this stuff (diabetes, kidney disease, sleep hygiene, etc) or she would be in for a truly hellish time.  She's had social workers/case managers/home health a few times and they suggested tools like life alert (a button you wear for emergencies), or wifi connected cameras to see what is going on. We talked about a wifi camera with a sort of frosty filter over it so it would still detect movement but I couldn't like, spy on what she was doing lol, she could have privacy. Just so I could check and see if she was alive/*something* in her house was around moving on a daily basis.  Ultimately she has lost the ability to drive and ended up moving in with me (which I expected but it took a while for her to come to the same conclusion and work together with me on it) and that has brought a lot of peace of mind.  Good luck with your mom, I hope you can find a solution which allows you to see how she is doing at a distance. ❤️❤️❤️	1747112356.0

Then there's the whole part about how they did little to nothing to actually try and save for their own retirement. And now it's our job to fix their fuck-ups? Why? Just because they decided to have kids they didn't want when they were too young and then be irresponsible and refuse to save their money or try and build a decent economy or prioritize public healthcare? Forget that. They made their bed, it's time they suffer the consequences of their choices for once in their lives. Boomers are the single most entitled generation to have ever been on this planet.

But "fuck you got mine" isn't the only issue - less regulated capitalism in an individualist and "work hard for your money" society contributes, too.      But even if it magically was announced tomorrow, and significant bridging supports are put in place, and there's population/ political will to get it done, and somehow the funding is found (difficult as raising taxes is seen as theft/political suicide to large portions of the country)....    The most difficult issue is staff availability; not just *trained* staff but just *people*. The US birth rate (1.6) is under the rate required to replace those dying (2.1). In other words, fewer taxpayers being born to shoulder the  tax burden *as it currently is*, not including to pay for increasing supports for the exploding older population bracket.      Like I said, it should be done. But it won't be this administration, and Democrats and the voting public historically haven't had enough will either.    Cultural changes can take longer than anything else to shift. I'm really hoping the USA culture can shift to help the vulnerable populations, and be willing to sacrifice a bit. We all get older, after all. 	1747111898.0

Tons of surgeries, treatments, 15+ pills a day, etc. literally over the course of 15 years. He withered away until he was in a wheelchair, couldn't walk, and needed constant oxygen, and probably weighed like 125lbs at 6ft tall.   He was 92 years old. Docs found something wrong with his heart and said if he didn't have surgery, it would probably take him. But docs also pointed out how risky surgery was at his age and condition.

ms1fa7e	MoonBapple	TL;DR Assume you will live, save whatever you can, and take care of your health. You are valuable.  It's difficult, but personally I believe it is worth saving everything you can. My mom had a somewhat difficult life, including at least one 30 day staycation in jail for a drug crime and almost a year of homelessness that left her very traumatized. She got therapy while she was homeless (great!) and her therapist would frequently ask her where she saw herself in 10 years. She'd say "dead," and dismiss any attempts by the therapist to offer alternative narratives.  Which, to be fair, at that point she was in her late 40s, and so far nearly everyone in her family had died in their late 50's of severe heart attacks or some other kind of sudden cardiovascular trauma like a stroke. She'd smoked since 12 years old, been overweight most of her life, done drugs, and now the stress of being homeless... Well, it didn't seem so farfetched.  (Just last week she had a heart surgery to clear out a "widowmaker" blockage and implant a stent. I told her I'm planning for her to live till she's 120, because I might as well assume she'll need my dedicated help for the next 48 years than be waiting around for her to die.)  **The point being that she legitimately didn't plan to live this long.** She inherited hundreds of thousands in her late 20's, didn't invest anything, didn't pay off debts, didn't save fuck all for retirement. I mean, she really fucked up financially at almost every opportunity and pissed away her money.  So while I'm shouldering her needs as an aging parent, I'm still aggressively socking away 19% of my income in retirement investments, because I've seen what it's like to retire with nothing but the goodwill of a child. I'm also trying my hardest to dodge health ailments common in my family, like heart disease and diabetes. When I'm 65, I'd like to be able to actively babysit my potential grandkids, not be an additional drain on the family unit. My daughter is 3 and my mom has never been able to babysit because of her various illnesses and mobility issues, and I want something different for my daughter.	1747110972.0

If you love someone you look after them, and if you have no one to look after you then you didnt do a good job raising them.	1747110955.0

It was arthroscopic. And then she had to go in for a second surgery because the arthroscopic one wouldn't remove what was wrong. She couldn't breathe on her own at the end of that one. And they caught her on the ventilator. She had her own Exit Plan I guess, because within 48 Hours when they tried to put her back on the blood thinners, she was bleeding out, and I told them that rather than torture her more they needed to let her go. That is the only reason she escaped. So make sure you specify no ventilator. Because they do not ask you about that.

ms1dhfg	Professor-Woo	Ya, this is why no one in our generation is going to really get any inheritance. Long-term care costs can easily blow through even very well-to-do people's retirement. And as the article alludes to, supply and demand is only going to make this even more expensive. A lot of baby boomers are going to need these services at the same time and since the working population is shrinking, there will simply not be enough people to even perform these services, even if they could pay for them. SS will also need to cut benefits or increase revenue at roughly that time as well. It is going to be a total shit show, especially since the baby boomer generation as a whole is totally unprepared for retirement under even the most optimistic of scenarios. I fully expect that society will be forced to subsidize this at an extreme cost because the only other option is homeless elderly boomers dying in the streets.	1747110165.0

ms1b77e	Professor-Woo	This is a pretty classic doctor experience. Doctors see all of the issues with aging and especially the people who are barely hanging in with a horrible quality of life. They then promise themselves they won't do that, that they won't try to hang on despite a bad quality of life, and will instead bow out gracefully when the time comes. However, this is said from the perspective of youth, when you haven't truly accepted that you will actually die one day. When that day approaches, a lot of Doctors realize they don't want to die and also have enough knowledge to know all of the possible options, even if very unlikely or impractical and they go all in.   My dad is a doctor, and he would always joke that he wants me to take him into the woods when he gets really old and help him sled off a cliff. We will see if he keeps that attitude.	1747109158.0

ms1a737	NYCQ7	Just looked up what you stated & that's not actually how it happened.  "History of the Program  The roots of the Medicare Advantage program can be traced to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, enacted in 1982. The act authorized Medicare to contract with risk-based private health plans in exchange for a monthly payment per enrollee. Later the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made the program official, calling it the Medicare+Choice program. The program was renamed as the Medicare Advantage Program (also known as “Part C” or “MA Plans”) in December 2003 under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003."

My mom is the oldest of all the boomers...get ready, y'all.  The not so dirty secret is that Americans are largely lucky in this regard since we have some of the best demographics in comparison to other countries.  We still have a lot of kids.  Other countries are _really_ screwed.  All those articles about people not getting married or having kids anymore mean other countries have far worse demographics than us (a caveat below).  Think about what China's one child policy mean - for every 4 grandparents, there is only 1 grandchild after 2 generations of the one child policy.  The demographics for Japan, Korea, Italy, and China look particularly bad.  Dealing with global population decline on this scale is somewhat unprecedented.  *Caveat* - Many countries outside the West have much stronger familial cultures that could lessen the intergenerational tension of these changes.  A country with worse demographics but a more supportive culture could manage these challenges better.	1747107947.0

My wife is an only child with a good relationship with her parents (I disowned my adopted parents, and for biological family I have siblings and have already laid out the expectation I owe none of them anything), and while she doesn't think her parents would want to move in with us (it would require immigration as well), I'd rather take no chances and have a bit of a safety buffer if needed.

ms17dyw	William_S_Burros	Sorry, but the absence of ketamine in your sources isn’t evidence of it being a last-line treatment or that doctors avoid it. As a medical expert, you should know that its use for depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc., is off-label, hence the limited info in the monograph. The bottom line is that, while ketamine may not be widely used yet, it’s also not some desperate Hail Mary, no matter how you try to characterize it that way. Its rapid growth in popularity is evidenced by the rise in clinics specifically using it for mental health conditions, and there is an equally fast-growing body of evidence pointing to its efficacy.  It is also not particularly dangerous, as you claimed. It’s a common anesthetic in emergency rooms specifically because of its safety and limited respiratory depression. And its anesthetic effects require significantly larger doses than are used in mental health treatments.  You’re criticizing a published study and pontificating your opinions, then acting sanctimonious and condescending when asked to support your claims. You’re a rando on the internet, so your appeal to authority by pointing to your supposed credentials as proof of your expertise is meaningless outside of your inflated ego. GTFOH	1747107520.0

Could you clarify your position a bit? Are you saying current AI models definitely can't become conscious, or just that right now we have no good reason to think they could? The strong analogies and softer phrasing seem a bit at odds, so I want to make sure I'm reading you right.	1747107447.0

ms167hf	FuturologyBot	The following submission statement was provided by /u/upyoars:  ---  > On May 3, 2025, researchers published a study titled Quantum Energy Teleportation across Multi-Qubit Systems using W-State Entanglement, detailing the first successful demonstration of energy teleportation in multi-qubit systems.  > Experiments on noiseless simulators and superconducting hardware successfully executed three-, four-, and five-qubit circuits, enabling a single sender to deterministically transfer energy E0 to multiple remote receivers. The results confirm that energy can be redistributed among entangled subsystems at light-speed-limited classical latency, paving the way for practical energy-aware networks. Traditionally, QET has been confined to two-qubit systems, limiting its practical applications.  > In contrast to traditional quantum teleportation, which involves sending quantum states using classical communication, energy teleportation centers on transferring energy itself. The exact mechanism isn’t fully detailed but suggests a novel approach that could revolutionize how energy is distributed and utilized in quantum technologies.  > Quantum energy teleportation presents advantages over classical methods through enhanced efficiency and security, highlighting its potential for future technological innovations. This work broadens the scope of quantum information science by introducing a new application of entanglement, paving the way for groundbreaking developments in energy distribution and quantum systems.  > While the current focus is on teleporting energy-related information rather than usable energy, the study underscores the importance of efficient state transfer for quantum tasks, offering valuable insights into both achievements and challenges in the field.  > Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) presents a novel approach to energy transfer by leveraging quantum entanglement, diverging from traditional teleportation methods that prioritise information over physical resources. The protocol hinges on using Bell states, enabling energy exchange through measurement and entanglement strength, which directly influences transfer fidelity. This method’s potential applications in efficient resource distribution within quantum networks highlight its transformative implications for computing and power systems fields.  ---   Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1klbe1u/quantum_energy_teleportation_achieved_in/ms110yp/	1747107028.0

Following got kind of long and thanks for doing your part against the shit your generation generally has gone for, it's a rant in general and is lots of the reasons why everyone younger than you thinks as a whole your generation failed.   Boomers as a generation started and joined a stupid amount of wars (war on drugs, war on terror being the biggest failures ever and still panicked on both fronts).    Equal rights I'm just going to laugh at, generally millennials aren't going to the polling booth with a "fuck women's rights and education we need more churches and pregnant teens." We also aren't voting on "Hey we don't want a planet with clean water, air, food without diseases", or the ever popular "Don't feed kids" that'd be people who are going to die before it affects them.   Also on average inherited more wealth than any other generation while ruining the labor market for everyone (largely got rid of unions, pensions, and have resisted any sort of sensible medical care that the rest of the world has figured out decades ago).  I work 2 jobs as does my wife...we make more than the median, don't have college debt (but do have college degrees and work in IT/finance), and don't live in a super high cost of living area...our spending power is   still lower than my parents who worked one job (welder, and CNA), they admit they went out every night, bought new cars every 3-4 years, bought new houses every couple of years and even built one....we keep our cars until they die, buy used, cook at home, couldn't possibly afford to upgrade our house (even without the interest rates), etc and barely manage to save the bare minimum 20% for retirement as it is.   No other voting block has ever gotten what they wanted as a demographic as much as boomers overall.  So much so you STILL have more than half of Congress as baby boomers...yes you as a generation get blamed because...as a generation...it's hard to find many positives done over the last 50 years by boomers other than tech which would probably have advanced anyway.

If a bunch of states pass it you have a new nation. If the old one wants to fight about it then we fight about it. But there is a way to do it without war. Just vote. If your state won’t let you vote about it then fuck the government and hold the vote without their participation. Without the people the government has no power. If you can write a better constitution then rational people will agree with it and vote for it. Who cares what the irrational people will vote for or what they want in general? They shouldn’t be in power or making decisions for the rest of us in the first place.   Remember, the USA started as 13 little states. Each new state had to vote for and ratify their intention to join the union and follow the constitution. If we voted ourselves into it we can vote ourselves out of it.

ms13qlf	squeakystuffed	We’ve nuclear-family’d ourselves to death.  Many (not all) long term facilities are in the business of keeping people alive ‘enough’ on the fewest pennies possible. It’s basically factory farming but with humans instead of chickens.  (Behold! A Man!)(poor joke)  The issues are that many elders could probably easily tend to most of their needs with home care but can’t afford one on their own, nor do they need one for 24h a day.  I think if more homes were modified to be more accessible and a few elders from different families could stay in a smaller house rather than large LTC, I think it could help a lot.  A lot of elder decline is because they’re lonely and often confined to their rooms in LTC.  So why not get 3 or 4 patients in a house and hire an RN and respite to have more personal care for way cheaper than it would be for each family to spend 5-15k a month on abysmal care.  Like the networks that homeschooling has. But for home-caregiving.  Plus, in smaller groups, there’s less likelihood of something like covid or noro coming in and risking dozens of patients and staff.  The RN or NP, and any respite staff, could still be paid decently, have reasonable shift lengths. Less chance of burnout. —  But trying to get my age, 40 and older, to accept living with roommates again is like suggesting they live in a box on the street.  I’m sure there’s a lot of logistics that I’m missing since I’m not in that profession, and I’m just rambling before my night meds kick in, but I don’t think it’s that unreasonable to think that this is an area that shouldn’t involve ceos and shareholders.  Along with the rest of the ridiculousness of the damn world, I firmly believe that connecting to the local community is gonna be how any of us survive the next 40 years.  That and petitioning our governments to allow for advance requests for the MAID program.  —  Personally I just need to figure a way to Rube Goldberg a contraption that will not implicate any loved ones in what I hope will be the blurst TEDtalk anyone’s ever given.	1747106020.0

There are probably a few CEOs who are overpaid, but the reality is that there just isn't much fat to cut.  When you think about the care (lets say 1 hour a day, washing, wiping, moving, dressing, cleaning) per person, then you have medical care (pills, 02 tanks, etc), then the facility, and a whole restaurant, you start to see why it gets so expensive.

ms110yp	upyoars	> On May 3, 2025, researchers published a study titled Quantum Energy Teleportation across Multi-Qubit Systems using W-State Entanglement, detailing the first successful demonstration of energy teleportation in multi-qubit systems.  > Experiments on noiseless simulators and superconducting hardware successfully executed three-, four-, and five-qubit circuits, enabling a single sender to deterministically transfer energy E0 to multiple remote receivers. The results confirm that energy can be redistributed among entangled subsystems at light-speed-limited classical latency, paving the way for practical energy-aware networks. Traditionally, QET has been confined to two-qubit systems, limiting its practical applications.  > In contrast to traditional quantum teleportation, which involves sending quantum states using classical communication, energy teleportation centers on transferring energy itself. The exact mechanism isn’t fully detailed but suggests a novel approach that could revolutionize how energy is distributed and utilized in quantum technologies.  > Quantum energy teleportation presents advantages over classical methods through enhanced efficiency and security, highlighting its potential for future technological innovations. This work broadens the scope of quantum information science by introducing a new application of entanglement, paving the way for groundbreaking developments in energy distribution and quantum systems.  > While the current focus is on teleporting energy-related information rather than usable energy, the study underscores the importance of efficient state transfer for quantum tasks, offering valuable insights into both achievements and challenges in the field.  > Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) presents a novel approach to energy transfer by leveraging quantum entanglement, diverging from traditional teleportation methods that prioritise information over physical resources. The protocol hinges on using Bell states, enabling energy exchange through measurement and entanglement strength, which directly influences transfer fidelity. This method’s potential applications in efficient resource distribution within quantum networks highlight its transformative implications for computing and power systems fields.	1747104960.0

The problem is that we don't understand how our own consciousness arises and all any current computing technology does is process instructions. There's no more reason for thinking even the most complex adaptive self editing machine learning genetic algorithm could be conscious than a warehouse full of all of the same decision trees in the code would be conscious because that's all it really is.

ms0zq87	Fubbalicious	Eh, my financial journey was only possible because I'm an elder millennial and got to min/max a lot of economically advantageous events.  So for example, tuition prices from 2000-2003 went from $4K/year to $9K/year 10 years later.  I also entered the job market while it was hot and gained enough seniority to avoid layoffs during the 2008 recession and bought real estate at the bottom of the dip in late 2009.  Then I got to invest during a very long bull market.  The only thing that could have made things better is had I done a cash out refinance in the 2020s when interest rates were below 3%, but opted instead to be 100% debt free.  However, this also came at the cost of working two jobs throughout my 20s, 30s and early 40s with only 1 vacation.  I also lived very frugally in order to afford my mortgage and had to live pay check to paycheck with no ability to save as I was extremely house poor despite having to work 2 jobs.  I only saw relief once the house was paid off early and suddenly $50k/year is now available to save towards retirement.	1747104458.0
ms0zptk	Cuntdracula19	2 showers a week is the standard. If someone refuses or even says, “not right now, maybe later,” you can kiss one of those showers goodbye, they just move along to the next resident. I’d say 1 shower a week at best is probably more accurate. But it isn’t uncommon for residents to go weeks without showering in memory care or if they’re just “difficult.” It is really sad. Having worked in LTC, it is the most draining, soul-crushing work out there. You are spread so thin and expected to make miracles happen with next to no resources, time, or help. Everyone is stressed out and feels guilty all the time for not being able to do more. I completely agree with you. I’d rather be here for a good time lol not a long time.	1747104454.0

Who’s supposed to take care of them until they burn out over the next 5-15 years? I certainly can’t afford to do it.
